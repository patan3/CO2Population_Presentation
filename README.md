# MDA-Presentation
This is the project presentation of the 'Modern Data Analytics' class at KU Leuven. 
The aim of this presentation is to provide a general view of the obtained results by illustrating interactive graphs to the reader. 
The rest of the analysis (i.e., Data Cleaning and Data Modelling) is not reported here.
The presentation has been made taking into account the limitation of 10 minutes for discussing its main results.
